Specificity: Does the prompt ask for a specific output, such as code, a mathematical solution, a logical simplification, a problem-solving strategy, or a hardware setup recommendation? This specificity allows the AI to demonstrate its ability to understand and generate precise responses.\n2. Domain Knowledge: Does the prompt cover a specific domain, such as programming, mathematics, logic, problem-solving, or hardware setup? Prompts spanning a range of topics test the AI's breadth of knowledge and its ability to apply that knowledge to different domains.\n3. Complexity: Does the prompt vary in complexity, from straightforward tasks to more complex, multi-step problems? This allows evaluators to assess the AI's capability to handle problems of varying difficulty.\n4. Problem-Solving Skills: Does the prompt directly involves the AI to demonstrate active problem-solving skills, such systemically coming up with a solution for a specific setup instead of regurgitating an existing fact? This tests the AI's ability to apply logical reasoning and provide practical solutions.\n5. Creativity: Does the prompt involve a level of creativity in approaching the problem? This criterion tests the AI's ability to provide tailored solutions that take into account the user's specific needs and limitations.\n6. Technical Accuracy: Does the prompt require technical accuracy in the response? This allows evaluators to assess the AI's precision and correctness in technical fields.\n7. Real-world Application: Does the prompt relate to real-world applications, such as setting up a functional system or writing code for a practical use case? This tests the AI's ability to provide practical and actionable information that could be implemented in real-life scenarios.\n\nYou must list the criteria numbers that the prompt satisfies in the format of a Python array. For example, \"[...]\". Do not explain your choice."

Carefully examine the user prompt and consider the following aspects:\n1. Does it contain specific instructions or requirements?\n2. Are there multiple steps or elements the AI needs to address?\n3. Does it ask for a particular format or structure in the response?\n4. Is there a unique or challenging aspect that would test the AI's ability to follow directions precisely?\n\nConsider both the content and the structure of the instructions. A good prompt for assessing instruction-following capabilities should have clear, specific directions that can be objectively evaluated. Think about why this prompt does or does not effectively assess an AI's ability to follow instructions. Consider both the strengths and weaknesses of the prompt in this regard. Output your verdict as a score from 0 to 5:\n0 = Does not evaluate instruction-following ability.\n1 = Ineffective at evaluating instruction-following ability.\n2 = Somewhat effective at evaluating instruction-following ability.\n3 = Effective at evaluating simple instruction-following ability.\n4 = Effective at evaluating more complex instruction-following ability.\n5 = Effective at evaluating advanced instruction-following ability.\n\nPresent your score in the following format:\n<score>[Your score from 0 to 5]</score>.\nDo NOT explain."
