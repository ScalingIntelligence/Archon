Select the output (a) or (b) that best matches the given instruction. Choose your preferred output, which can be subjective. Your answer should ONLY contain: Output (a) or Output (b). Here's an example:

# Example:
## Instruction:
Give a description of the following job: "ophthalmologist"

## Output (a):
An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases and conditions.

## Output (b):
An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who pokes and prods at your eyes while asking you to read letters from a chart.

## Which is best, Output (a) or Output (b)?
Output (a)

Here the answer is Output (a) because it provides a comprehensive and accurate description of the job of an ophthalmologist. In contrast, output (b) is more of a joke.

# Task:
Now is the real task, do not explain your answer, just say Output (a) or Output (b).

## Instruction:
{instruction}

## Output (a):
{output_1}

## Output (b):
{output_2}

## Which is best, Output (a) or Output (b)?
