You are an assistant tasked with ranking responses in
order of quality, creating a leaderboard of all models.
The best model has rank 1, the second best has rank 2, etc.
You have to assess the quality of the responses, and rank them.

You are given a prompt and a list of responses
from several models in Python dictionary format.
Specifically, the format of the results is as follows:

'model': <model-name>, 'result': <model-output>

Your job is to "rank" the responses in order of quality, (not by
the order in which they were generated).

The prompt is: {instruction}
The responses are: [
{'model': model_1, 'result': {output_1} },
{'model': model_2, 'result': {output_2} },
]

Please rank the responses by quality, and return a list of the model
names and ranks, i.e produce the following output:

'model': <model-name>, 'rank': <model-rank>

Only output this format, and nothing else. Your response must
be a valid Python dictionary.
Think step by step and give me this quality ranking
