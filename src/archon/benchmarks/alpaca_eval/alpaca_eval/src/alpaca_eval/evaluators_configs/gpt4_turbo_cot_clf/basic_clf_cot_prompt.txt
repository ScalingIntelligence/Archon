Select the output A or B that best matches the given instruction. Choose your preferred output, which can be subjective. Your answer should first contain a concise explanation and then it should end with ONLY the token: `A` or `B` (no dot, no backticks, no new line, no quotes, no 'it depends', no 'both' ...), because we will use `output[-1]` to extract the best output.

Here's an example:

# Example:
## Instruction:
Give a description of the following job: "ophthalmologist"

## Output A:
An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of eye diseases and conditions.

## Output B:
An ophthalmologist is a medical doctor who pokes and prods at your eyes while asking you to read letters from a chart.

## Concise explanation followed by `A` or `B`

### Concise explanation
A provides a comprehensive and accurate description of the job of an ophthalmologist. In contrast, B is more of a joke.

### Which is best, `A` or `B`?
A

# Task:

## Instruction:

## Output `A`:
